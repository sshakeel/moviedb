## Demo

You can view this project's live demo here: https://sshakeel.github.io/moviedb-sample (best viewed on mobile devices)

## Local Setup

To view the project on your own end, you will need your own Movie DB API Key. You can grab your own key [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup)

Once you have your key, update *Line #1* `js/index.js` and `js/movie-details.js` files which looks like the following;

`var APIKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";`

Simply replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your own API key and visit `index.html` in your browser.
